Prior to publication, the manuscript was put on the Chemrxiv preprint server. This version can be fonud at

Here, we report the binding poses explored from our 3D enhanced sampling simulations. 
The top-6 stable structures are provided in the pdb format. 

These binding poses are also used as the starting bound configuration (initial guess) in alchemical and end-point free energy calculations. The alchemical and end-point paper is also published in JCAMD. The published version can be found at
